    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>.
        In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is
        aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
        In his book, <i>Cooking fir Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat ar the
        chef table, contact us before
        <time>November 30</time>.
