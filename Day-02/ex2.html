<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>.
    In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is
    aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
    In his book, <em>Cooking fir Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat ar the
    chef table, contact us before <time>November 30</time>.</p>
